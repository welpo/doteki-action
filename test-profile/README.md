## ☝️🤓 Fact of the day

<!-- did_you_know start -->
People do not use only 10% of their brains. While it is true that a small minority of neurons in the brain are actively firing at any one time, a healthy human will normally use most of their brain over the course of a day, and the inactive neurons are important as well.

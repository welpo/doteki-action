# üéã Run d≈çteki Action

This GitHub action runs [d≈çteki](https://doteki.org) to update your GitHub profile README with dynamic content.

## Usage

1. Follow the [Initial Setup instructions from d≈çteki](https://doteki.org/docs) to set up `doteki.toml` and the matching markers in `README.md`.

2. In your profile repository, create the workflow file `.github/workflows/doteki.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: Update README with d≈çteki

on:
  push:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: '51 * * * *'  # Every hour at XX:51.

jobs:
  update-readme:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write  # Necessary to push changes.
    steps:
      - name: Run d≈çteki action
        uses: welpo/doteki-action@main
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

This workflow will run every time you push to your repository, every hour at XX:51, and when you manually trigger it from the Actions tab.

<details>
<summary>What's inside the workflow file?</summary>
<ul>
    <li><b><code>name</code>:</b> 'Update README with d≈çteki' labels the action. You'll see this name in the Actions tab.</li>
    <li><b><code>on</code>:</b> Indicates when the action should run. In this case, it runs on push, when manually triggered, and every hour at XX:51.</li>
    <li><b><code>jobs</code>:</b> The 'update-readme' job defines the action's tasks.</li>
    <li><b><code>runs-on</code>:</b> The job runs on the latest Ubuntu version ('ubuntu-latest').</li>
    <li><b><code>permissions</code>:</b> 'contents: write' allows changes to the repository. Otherwise the README couldn't be updated.</li>
    <li><b><code>steps</code>:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Runs the latest version of the d≈çteki action ('welpo/doteki-action@main').</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b><code>env</code>:</b> Uses 'GITHUB_TOKEN' to authenticate with GitHub. This is necessary to push changes to the repository.</li>
</ul>
</details>

3. Commit and push the workflow file to your repository.

4. That's it! The action will run automatically and update your README.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I configure d≈çteki?

Simply modify `doteki.toml` and the README markers. [See the docs](https://doteki.org/docs/configuration/).

You don't need to modify the workflow file unless you want to change the schedule, the `doteki-action` version, or the environment variables.

### A plugin needs me to set an environment variable. How do I do that?

If a plugin is asking you to set an environment variable, it's because it needs to access sensitive information, such as an API key. If you added this information to `doteki.toml`, it would be visible to anyone who can see your repository.

The solution is to use GitHub's [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).

On your profile repository, go to the "Settings" tab and click on "Secrets and variables", then "Actions".

There you can create a new repository secret, say, "lastfm", and add the value for the variable there:

![Creating a secret](assets/secret.png)

Finally, in your workflow file, add a line at the end of the `steps` section, inside `env`:

```yaml
env:
  DOTEKI_LASTFM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.lastfm }}
```

**Note**: The string on the left side is the name of the environment variable that the plugin expects. `secrets.<name>` must match the name of the secret you created.

### Something didn't go as expected. Where can I find logs?

Open your GitHub profile repository and go to the "Actions" tab. There you will find a list of all the workflows that have been run:

![Actions tab](assets/actions_tab.png)

Click on the one you are interested in, and then on the "update-readme" job.

There you can search the logs or open the "Run d≈çteki action" step to see the full logs. For example, if you used an invalid Last.fm API key, you would see:

![Logs showing a lastfm plugin error"](assets/lastfm_error.png)

### I have a question that is not answered here. What should I do?

Don't hesitate to reach out via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/welpo/doteki-action/issues), [discussions](https://github.com/welpo/doteki-action/discussions), or [email](mailto:osc@osc.garden?subject=[GitHub]%20d≈çteki-action).
